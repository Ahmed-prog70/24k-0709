Implement an algorithm for making a simple calculator with all the operators (+,-,*,/,%)
1. Ask the user to enter the first number.
2.Ask the user to enter the operator (one of +, -, *, /, %).
3.Ask the user to enter the second number.
4.If the operator is +, then add the two numbers.
5.If the operator is -, then subtract the second number from the first.
6.If the operator is *, multiply both numbers.
7.If the operator is /, divide the first number by the second (assuming the second number is not zero).
8.If the operator is %, calculate the remainder when the first number is divided by the second.
9.Show the result of the calculation.
