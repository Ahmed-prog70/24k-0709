The first condition (5 > 8) is false, hence the phrase moves to the second portion. 1 != 2 < 5 ? 20: 30.
Second condition: (1!= 2 < 5)
Since 2 < 5 is true (1), we get 1!= 1, which is untrue.
Since both conditions are false, x is assigned the else portion (30).First condition (5>8): This is false, hence the phrase proceeds to the second part: (1 != 2 < 5 ? 20: 30).
Since both conditions are false, x is assigned the else portion (30).
